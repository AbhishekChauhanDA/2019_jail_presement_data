# 2019_jail_presement_data
** About This Project
**
This project explores data from 2019 related to jail life presement. I used Python for data cleaning and analysis, and Power BI to build interactive dashboards that help visualize trends like population breakdowns, facility conditions, and more.

The goal is to make the data easier to understand and highlight patterns that might not be obvious at first glance. Whether you're curious about how jail populations have changed, or just want to see the power of combining Python with Power BI, this project gives a clear, visual overview.
